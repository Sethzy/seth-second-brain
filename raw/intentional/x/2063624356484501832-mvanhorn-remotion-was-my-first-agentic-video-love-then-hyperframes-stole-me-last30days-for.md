## Verbatim Text

Remotion Was My First Agentic Video Love. Then HyperFrames Stole Me. /last30days for both

Remotion was the first tool that let me ship a real launch video from a terminal, and I fell hard. Every video I made this spring started as a React composition. Then HyperFrames came along, and somewhere around the Granola CLI demo and the Agent Cookie launch reel, it quietly took over my whole video workflow. I felt a little guilty about it. So I did what I always do before I trust a feeling: I ran [/last30days](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill) on Remotion prompting, on HyperFrames, and on the head-to-head, and read what the community actually says.

The verdict surprised me: the community is not having the fight I expected. Both tools are winning, for different jobs, and the people getting the best results out of each one follow prompting playbooks that have quietly converged into doctrine. This article is the verdict, the receipts, and both playbooks.

## 🥊 The verdict the community already reached: stop picking sides

The sharpest framing in the whole corpus came from Markandey Sharma:

> HyperFrames vs Remotion isn't about tools it's about the medium. HyperFrames uses HTML, which LLMs naturally understand. (Markandey Sharma, May 2026)

That is the entire debate in two sentences. Remotion (49K stars, shipping since 2021) bets that video should be typed React components, written by developers, reviewed like code, rendered at hyperscale on Lambda. HyperFrames (25K stars in roughly two months since HeyGen open sourced it) bets that the author is no longer a developer. The author is an agent, and agents grew up on HTML. HeyGen engineer Joshua Xu's rationale, per Nidhin's deep dive: LLMs are trained on oceans of HTML, while React plus Remotion is a sliver of the training data.

And the community has stopped treating that as a war. Sabrina Ramonov lists them as items 1 and 2 of the same "unlimited free AI videos" stack (19K views on TikTok this week alone). Hermes ships both as built-in video skills: Remotion for programmatic motion graphics, HyperFrames for quick compositions. Corey Haines built a router skill that picks between HeyGen, Remotion, HyperFrames, and Runway per request. Even HyperFrames' own comparison guide credits Remotion for pioneering the rendering patterns it builds on: headless Chrome, frame-by-frame capture, FFmpeg encoding.

Nobody serious is asking which one wins. They are asking which one fits the job in front of them. The honest answer to both questions lives in what each community says about its own tool.

## 🎬 What /last30days pulled up on Remotion

The Remotion story this month is a mature project having its creator moment. Jonny Burger announced the milestone himself:

> Remotion has passed the break-even point! We've recouped our investments and are now in the green. (@JNYBGR, May 26, 2026)

Five years of work, now sustainable, and shipping: the new version has visual editing with two-way sync between code and preview, where code is always the source of truth. The agent skill, remotion-dev/skills, turned a React framework into a creator phenomenon. Sabrina's Remotion reel did 152K views on TikTok plus 61K on Instagram. The Codex plugin demo did 246K views. Chronixel's tutorial (58K views): "I installed this incredible tool and just watched days of my life come back to me."

Remotion is also where my own video story starts. The last30days launch video from January is every line a React composition written from a prompt:

The honest part, and the reason the prompting playbook below exists, is what practitioners admit once the demo glow fades:

> claude code wrote every line of our 50s launch video in remotion. it took ~100 prompts, not 1. the first few iterations all looked like a powerpoint. (r/ClaudeAI, May 12, 2026)

And the sharpest critique anywhere in the corpus is about taste, not tooling:

> If there's one telltale sign of AI motion graphics is the terrible pacing. They only know constant easing, no tension relief, no sharp cuts, no short fades. (r/ClaudeAI, May 2026)

Remotion is great. Remotion driven by a lazy prompt looks like a slideshow with spring physics. The playbook below is how the community closes that gap.

## 🧱 What /last30days pulled up on HyperFrames

The HyperFrames story is a two-month-old project growing faster than its own documentation. The convert's arc, in one post:

> Writing HTML to render video sounds like a hack. Then you see the output. (@chenzeling4, June 4, 2026)

r/heygen has turned into a show-and-tell: particle motion experiments, bar chart races, recipe videos, movie trailers, 3D renders. "hyperframes + claude code is my workflow. I post the good ones on this sub," per one tinkerer pushing it to its limits. The reach is global in a way dev tools rarely are: a Portuguese explainer did 36K views, a Telugu reel did 55K, and the best fun quote of the window came from @kikemarqx: "the framework I was building... they shipped first"

It runs everywhere agents run: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Hermes. The setup is one line, the license is Apache 2.0, and there is no React toolchain between you and an MP4. This is the tool that took over my launch videos. The Agent Cookie reel last week was written as HTML and rendered to MP4 without opening an editor:

[Embedded Tweet: https://x.com/i/status/2061259423197372566]

style visuals, and caption highlights written in HTML/CSS beat hand-rolling FFmpeg by a lot, but burned a full hour of Claude quota on a single talking-head video and then waited five hours for the reset. The community fix arrived in his replies:

> you can make a hyperframes template so you don't have to burn tokens to make new HTML files each time! and you would just need to change the variables in the render step (@Miguel07Code, June 7, 2026)

The skeptics get their say too: "Most people just want templates not CLI tools. Try remotion or jsoncut the results are way better imho," per r/ProductHunters. And it lost the only direct head-to-head test in the window: one builder tried both in Codex and found Remotion still stronger for his scenario. Young project, real friction, absurd momentum.

## 📊 Head-to-head

## 🛠️ How to prompt Remotion: the six-move playbook

This is the doctrine that emerged across the highest-signal guides and confessionals of the last 30 days.

Move 1: Install the skill before you describe anything. remotion-dev/skills gives the agent a working mental model of scenes, timing, and composition. Without it, the agent reaches for web animations that break during render.

Move 2: Make the first prompt about structure, not visuals. "The first prompt is not about visuals. It is about structure," per NemoVideo's guide. Before any code, write a 5-scene script where each scene gets a one-line headline, 1-2 sentences of explanation, and a visual description.

Move 3: Use numbers, not adjectives. Say 80px, not "large font." Declare resolution, FPS, and duration up front. Build incrementally: layout first, then animation, then colors and fonts last.

Move 4: Budget 3 to 100 prompts and stop feeling bad about it. The one-shot launch video is a myth the confessionals have killed. Three iterations is a good demo. A hundred is a polished 50-second launch video. The first pass will look like PowerPoint. That is the workflow, not a failure.

Move 5: Ask for constants-first code. Sabrina's pattern: every text string, color, and timing value declared as an editable constant at the top of the composition. Change a constant, not a conversation. This is what makes iteration cheap enough to afford move 4.

Move 6: Fight the pacing problem explicitly. The agent only knows constant easing. Tell it the rhythm you want: where the sharp cut goes, which beat holds, which transition is a short fade. For automation, make the script a JSON intermediate the agent fills, then render: one builder's /ai-video command researches popular posts, generates the script as JSON, and renders a 60-second Apple-Event-style video.

Do: hand the agent a storyboard with timing, elements, and transitions before the first prompt. Don't: type "make me a cool launch video" and expect anything but a powerpoint.

A starter you can paste: Install remotion-dev/skills first. Then build a 50-second launch video at 1920x1080, 30fps. Here is the 5-scene script: [scene: headline, 1-2 lines of explanation, visual description, duration in seconds]. Declare every text string, color, and timing value as editable constants at the top. Layout first. After I approve layout, add animation: vary the easing per scene, one sharp cut at scene 3, hold the final beat for 2 seconds.

## ⚡ How to prompt HyperFrames: the six-move playbook

Same exercise, HyperFrames corpus. The official prompting guide plus the field reports converge on this.

Move 1: Install the skill, then warm-start with material. Run npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes. The official guide describes two prompt shapes: describe from scratch, or hand the agent material to synthesize: a URL, a PDF, a CSV, a changelog, a transcript. Warm-start prompts produce richer videos. A GitHub repo becomes a launch reel. A CSV becomes an animated bar chart race.

Move 2: Speak the pacing dialect. The skill maps adjectives to timing: fast (0.2s) reads as energy, medium (0.4s) as professional, slow (0.6s) as luxury, very slow (1-2s) as cinematic. Say "luxury pacing" and the agent knows what you mean in seconds-per-beat. This is the closest thing either tool has to a built-in answer to the pacing problem.

Move 3: Edit like a conversation, not a regeneration. "Make the title 2x bigger." "Move the caption up." Incremental edits to the existing composition, never re-prompting from scratch. One creator's intro animation took 20 minutes and 26 prompts, and that is the workflow working, not failing.

Move 4: Templatize or burn tokens. This is the cost discipline the power users converged on after the hour-of-quota story above. Build your best composition once, then swap variables at render time. HeyGen's own Lambda guide ships this pattern: your best composition becomes a template, build once, scale forever. The best receipt in the corpus is the r/heygen user who spent one full day training brand guidelines, color templates, custom icons, and a logo into a customized setup, and now gets single-prompt videos with no revision.

Move 5: Lint and validate before you render. npx hyperframes lint catches structural issues, npx hyperframes validate catches runtime errors, missing assets, and contrast problems. The complaints about overlapping words and prompt text leaking into the video are exactly the class of bug you catch before spending a render.

Move 6: Pin your fonts. My own hard-won one: the renderer maps a fixed font set, and system fonts like SF Mono and SF Pro silently fall back and break your monospace alignment at render time. Specify Inter and JetBrains Mono in the composition. And know what still breaks: counters, maps, and product demos fly, while realistic character motion still falls apart.

Do: hand it your changelog, your repo, your brand kit, and let it synthesize. Don't: regenerate fresh HTML for every video in a series. That is the token burn everyone complains about.

A starter you can paste: Install the HyperFrames skill, then npx hyperframes init. Here is my changelog [paste] and brand kit: Inter for display, JetBrains Mono for code, colors [hex list]. Build a 30-second release announcement at 1080x1920, professional pacing (0.4s beats), captions on every scene. Run npx hyperframes lint and validate before rendering. Then save this composition as a template with the headline, stats, and accent color as swappable variables.

## 🧭 My playbook: which one I reach for, and when

Here is where I admit the headline is true. Remotion taught me that a launch video could come out of a conversation. I built a whole knowledge base around prompting it, and that work still pays off. But every launch video I have shipped since May, the Granola CLI demo, the Agent Cookie reel, the Suno video, came out of HyperFrames. Each one is a folder with a script.md, scene by scene, and an agent that turns it into an MP4 with no editor and no timeline. The loop is identical to how I ship code, and the cost of a video dropped to the cost of a conversation. I even drop rendered demos straight into PRs now.

So my honest router, the one I actually use. One-off launch reel, product demo, captioned clip, animated explainer for this week: HyperFrames. The agent writes HTML natively, the warm-start pattern eats my changelogs and brand kit, and the template discipline keeps the token bill sane. A video product, 100 templated variants, anything a team maintains in code review, anything that needs Lambda-scale rendering: Remotion. It is the incumbent for a reason, the docs are five years deep, and it won the only blind quality test this month. Either way, the agent is the editor. The renderer is a per-job choice. That is the real shift of 2026: the platform is the coding agent, and both of these are skills it loads.

Remotion was my first love and it is still great. HyperFrames is what I reach for on a Tuesday. The community data says I am not crazy: both are growing, both playbooks work, and the people shipping the best video right now keep both installed.

## 🔑 Key patterns from the research

The medium is the bet: Remotion bets on React developers, HyperFrames bets on agents writing HTML. One-shot is dead on both tools: 3 to 100 prompts on Remotion, 26 prompts per intro on HyperFrames. Structure-first prompting is the fix. Cost discipline differs: constants-first code on Remotion, templates with variable swaps on HyperFrames. Pacing is the quality ceiling: constant easing is the AI tell, and the adjective-to-seconds mapping is HyperFrames' head start. The agent is the platform: Hermes ships both, routers pick per job, and the people shipping the best video keep both installed.
