## Verbatim Text

Use OpenClaw? Try ClawRouter to save 70% of my $4660.87 Anthropic bills. 400 stars in 2 day

I have a confession to make. Last month I looked at my credit card statement and almost threw up. Anthropic charged me $4,660.87., just for AI APIs.

I use OpenClaw every day.  But I never stopped to think about what I was actually paying for.

Here's what I discovered when I finally looked: I had Claude Opus set as my default model. Most request, no matter how simple, went to Opus.
I am paying fifteen dollars per million tokens to do tasks that a two-dollar model handles perfectly fine.

## The Inefficiency Trap

That realization kept me up at night. I started thinking about all the requests I make in a typical day.
Most of them are simple. Really simple. Autocomplete this line. Explain this error. Fix this syntax.

Maybe twenty percent of what I do actually requires a powerful model. The rest is basic stuff that any decent LLM can handle. 80% of my requests were simple. I dont know when were routed to the most expensive model. But because switching models manually is annoying, because I didn't want to think about it for every request, I just left everything on Opus and hemorrhaged money.

## Enter ClawRouter

So I built something to fix it. within @BlockRunAI

I call it ClawRouter, and the idea is dead simple. It sits between @openclaw  and the AI providers as an intelligent layer. Every time you send a request, it looks at what you're asking and automatically picks the cheapest model that can handle it.

- Simple autocomplete goes to @deepseek_ai  at $0.28 per million tokens

- Basic code questions go to GPT-4o at $2.50

- Actual complex debugging goes to Claude Sonnet at $3.00

- Only the genuinely hard multi-step reasoning problems go to Opus at $25.00  The right tool for the job. Every time.

## The routing decision happens locally on your machine. Open source

I built a scoring system that evaluates fourteen different dimensions of your prompt: code complexity, reasoning depth, context length, whether it needs structured output, and so on. The whole evaluation takes less than one millisecond. You literally cannot perceive it happening. There's no API call for the routing itself. No added latency. Your request just quietly goes to the right model.

open sourced it last week because I figured other people were probably making the same mistake I was.

Put it on GitHub. Wrote some docs. Posted about it once.

400 GitHub stars in 48 hours.

https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter

You install the plugin, set your model to "blockrun/auto", configure a wallet with some USDC on Base, and you're done.

Every request from that point forward routes automatically. You get access to over thirty models across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Kimi 2.5 and xAI, all through one wallet, no separate accounts needed anywhere.
