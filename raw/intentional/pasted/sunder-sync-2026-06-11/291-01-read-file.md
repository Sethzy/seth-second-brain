  "description": "Reads the contents of a file or directory by its path. If the path is a directory, returns a recursive tree-style listing of its contents. Image files are displayed directly. For PDF files, returns pages as images by default to preserve visual layout, formatting, and diagrams. Use format='text' to extract text content only. Specify optional start_line/end_line or start_page/end_page for large files. Use negative indices to count from the end (e.g., start_line: -10, end_line: -1 reads the last 10 lines).",
