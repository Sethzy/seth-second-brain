# Fintool Patterns and Features - PM Master List

## Why this file exists
This is a complete plain-language list of the product and operating patterns shared across the Fintool materials in this folder.

For each pattern, this file explains:
1. What it is
2. What implementing it would achieve

---

## A) Product Experience Patterns

1. **Chat is the main product surface**
What it is: Users ask in one chat instead of clicking many tabs.
What this achieves: Faster onboarding, less confusion, and much faster feature rollout because new capabilities show up in chat immediately.
Source: `donovanso-fintool-chat-only-hyper-personalized-FULL.md`

2. **"Just ask" feature discovery**
What it is: Users do not need to know where features live; they ask naturally.
What this achieves: Better adoption of features that would otherwise stay hidden.
Source: `donovanso-fintool-chat-only-hyper-personalized-FULL.md`

3. **Hyper-personalized responses by default**
What it is: The assistant uses each user's own context (watchlists, preferences, past work).
What this achieves: More relevant outputs and stronger retention because the assistant feels tailored.
Source: `donovanso-fintool-chat-only-hyper-personalized-FULL.md`

4. **Structured questions during tasks**
What it is: The assistant can pause and ask clear multiple-choice or form-like questions mid-task.
What this achieves: Better quality output with less back-and-forth confusion.
Source: `donovanso-fintool-chat-only-hyper-personalized-FULL.md`, `nicbustamante-fintool-lessons-building-ai-agents-FULL.md`

5. **Rich results directly in chat**
What it is: Chat can render tables, charts, formulas, files, and document previews.
What this achieves: Users can review outcomes without leaving chat.
Source: `donovanso-fintool-chat-only-hyper-personalized-FULL.md`

6. **Chat-first onboarding**
What it is: Onboarding happens through guided conversation instead of a long setup form.
What this achieves: Lower activation drop-off and faster first value.
Source: `ishanxnagpal-ai-agent-fde-forward-deployed-engineer-FULL.md`, `jesseprovo-fintool-background-agents-reactive-to-proactive-FULL.md`

## B) Learning and Personalization Loops

7. **Learning loop (remember user style)**
What it is: Capture user preferences once and reuse every session.
What this achieves: The assistant stops asking repeated setup questions and feels "stateful."
Source: `ishanxnagpal-ai-agent-fde-forward-deployed-engineer-FULL.md`

8. **Automation loop (detect repeated work)**
What it is: A scheduled review of past conversations to find repeated workflows.
What this achieves: The assistant proactively suggests automation opportunities.
Source: `ishanxnagpal-ai-agent-fde-forward-deployed-engineer-FULL.md`

9. **Outreach loop (re-engage inactive users)**
What it is: If a user goes quiet, the assistant sends relevant updates based on their interests.
What this achieves: Better retention and reactivation without spam.
Source: `ishanxnagpal-ai-agent-fde-forward-deployed-engineer-FULL.md`

10. **Weekly proactive skill suggestions**
What it is: A weekly run that proposes reusable workflows the user should save.

What this achieves: Better continuity in reasoning and less context loss.
Source: `jesseprovo-fintool-background-agents-reactive-to-proactive-FULL.md`

13. **Drift detection on key assumptions**
What it is: The assistant checks whether new information weakens prior assumptions.
What this achieves: Early warning when strategy should change.
Source: `jesseprovo-fintool-background-agents-reactive-to-proactive-FULL.md`

14. **Dynamic screens that update automatically**
What it is: Saved criteria lists that auto-refresh as new events arrive.
What this achieves: Continuous opportunity discovery without manual re-screening.
Source: `jesseprovo-fintool-background-agents-reactive-to-proactive-FULL.md`

15. **Permission-based deep onboarding**
What it is: With user approval, the assistant learns from real artifacts (notes, models, docs).
What this achieves: Better personalization than simple preference forms.
Source: `jesseprovo-fintool-background-agents-reactive-to-proactive-FULL.md`

## Practical summary for PMs
If you implement the full set above, you get a product that:
1. Feels simple to users (one chat surface).
2. Gets better with each customer over time (learning + compounding skills).
3. Is safer and more reliable in production (sandboxing, idempotence, durable workflows, tests).
4. Balances cost and quality with explicit policies (model routing, self-verification for high-stakes tasks).
5. Builds a stronger moat through context and proprietary signal accumulation, not UI complexity.
